Welcome To Python Socket Host And Client!


installation = 

git clone https://github.com/Thman558/Python-Socket-Host-And-Client

cd Python-Socket-Host-And-Client
(you may have to do pip3 install tqdm) if you have any errors installing
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE PYTHON3 NOT PYTHON2

python3 PythonSocketHost.py
if you are hosting the server and

python3 socket client.py if you are the "Client"

Have not tried any other clients but they will probably work

If you have any issues please report them in "Issues" And they will be fixed as soon as possible.

to see if your os is supported visit the wiki (probably is)
